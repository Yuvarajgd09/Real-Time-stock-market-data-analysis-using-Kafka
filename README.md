# Real-Time-stock-market-data-analysis-using-Kafka

The Stock Market Data Analysis project aims to process and analyze real-time stock market data using a scalable and serverless architecture powered by AWS services. The system ingests stock market data streams through Apache Kafka hosted on AWS EC2 instances, stores raw and processed data on Amazon S3, and utilizes AWS Athena for querying and analyzing the data. The project incorporates AWS Glue Crawlers to automate schema discovery and data cataloging, while Python is used for data processing, transformation, and analysis.

This solution provides a comprehensive framework for handling large volumes of stock market data and enables real-time or batch analysis to gain insights into stock trends, market movements, and trading strategies.
